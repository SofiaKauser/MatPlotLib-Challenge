Pymaceuticals Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.


In a recent animal study, this study of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

In this project I will be looking at all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study and presenting top-level summary of the study results.

### What was involved in the project

Observations and Insights
The regimen count shows Capomulin has maximum mice on the study (230) and Zoniferol has the smallest number (182) The correlation between average tumor volume and weight is 0.84
